# React Memory Game

This app is a basic React app using create-react-app to run a simple server. The user loads the page and sees a jumbotron with basic instructions. They select images from a randomly sorted array and try to not repeat them. If they get through all 12, an alert pops up then resets. If they don't the game resets.
## Getting Started
